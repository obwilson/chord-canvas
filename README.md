# Chord Canvas

A python tool to help easily create and export chord progressions without the hassle of
figuring out the chords available to you in a certain key.

The program allows for easy saving and loading of projects and exporting to a MIDI file
which allows seamless integration with any Digital Audio Workstation, such as
Garageband, to continue working with the project.
